## Features

- gender
- chest pain type
- resting blood pressure
- serum cholestrol
- fasting blood pressure
- resting electrocardiographic results
- maximum heart rate achieved
- exercise induced angina
- oldpeak
- slope of the peak exercise st segment
- number of major vessels colored by flouroscopy
- thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
